# DSCoin Project

## Introduction

Welcome to DSCoin, a cryptocurrency project designed to extend the basic concepts of blockchain into a nearly complete cryptocurrency system. This project builds upon the blockchain concepts introduced in Lab Module 5.

## Overview

DSCoin is a cryptocurrency where each coin is a unique six-digit number. Every transaction involves a coin transfer from a source (buyer) to a destination (seller) and is added to a transaction queue before being included in a transaction block. These blocks form an authenticated, linked list known as a blockchain.

## DSCoin: Our Cryptocurrency

### DSCoin Honest

In the DSCoin Honest version, miners behave honestly. All participants receive initial coins from a moderator. Transactions follow these steps:

1. **Buyer adds transaction** to the transaction-queue.
2. **Miner collects transactions**, mines a transaction-block, and adds it to the blockchain.
3. **Buyer checks** their transaction in the latest block and sends a proof of payment to the seller.
4. **Seller verifies** the proof of payment.

### DSCoin Malicious

In DSCoin Malicious, we handle the possibility of dishonest miners by using a tree-like blockchain structure, where each block points to its predecessor. Honest miners attach new blocks to the longest valid chain, ensuring the integrity of the blockchain.

## System Components

### Transaction

A transaction includes:
- `coinID`: Unique identifier of the coin
- `source`: Buyer’s identification
- `destination`: Seller’s identification
- `coinsrc_block`: Block where the coin was last received

### Transaction Block

A transaction block includes:
- `tr-count`: Number of transactions (power of 2)
- `trarray`: Array of transactions
- `trsummary`: 64-character summary of the transactions
- `Tree`: Merkle tree on `trarray`
- `nonce`: 10-digit string
- `dgst`: 64-character digest

### Blockchain

An authenticated linked list of transaction blocks. Each block points to its predecessor.

### Mining

Miners collect valid transactions from the queue, create a transaction block, and compute a nonce to generate a valid block digest.

## Transaction Flow

### Initializing a Coin-Send

1. Buyer creates a transaction `t` and adds it to the transaction queue.
2. Buyer also adds `t` to their own queue of pending transactions.

### Mining a Transaction Block

1. Miner collects valid transactions.
2. Miner creates a transaction block with the following steps:
   - Adds transactions to `trarray`.
   - Computes the Merkle tree and `trsummary`.
   - Finds a nonce such that the digest starts with four zeros.
   - Adds the transaction block to the blockchain.

### Finalizing a Coin-Send

Once a transaction is in a block, the buyer sends proof to the seller, who verifies it using the blockchain data.

### Verification of Transaction by the Seller

The seller verifies:
- They are the transaction’s destination.
- The transaction’s Merkle path.
- The validity of block digests.

## Handling Malicious Miners

The blockchain is structured as a tree. Honest miners ensure the longest valid chain is maintained, which includes only valid blocks.

## Differences from Real-World Cryptocurrencies

- **UIDs**: In DSCoin, each person has a UID. In Bitcoin, a verification key serves as the UID.
- **Transactions**: DSCoin assumes single-coin transactions. Real cryptocurrencies allow multiple coins per transaction.
- **Incentives**: In real-world settings, transactions may include miner rewards to incentivize transaction inclusion.

## Conclusion

DSCoin provides a simplified yet robust cryptocurrency model, simulating real-world blockchain and mining operations while addressing the issue of malicious miners through structural and incentive mechanisms.
